    <p>app using android studio and the KRPC library to be able to control a plan in the game Kerbal Space Program. 
    Done with a deadline so everything is buttons, if enough time was given i would figure out how to use the phones built in 
    accelerometer. This was done as a proof of concept and required a lot of work to be done server-side, more than I ever want to do again.
    Input lag was also a problem (causing bad flying) again due to server side issues.</p>
    <h2>Text-based adventure</h2>
    <p>still in the works, control a craft using text commands, should be horrible to control but thats the idea</p>
