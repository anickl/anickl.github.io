          there is a lone god on a planet, bored he starts life to see what happens and tp prevent boredom. below the god is many lesser gods ment to report on whatever they were intended to report on.
in this system there are 2 planets in binary (and tidally locked) the larger of the 2 planets begins to grow life to the enjoyment of the god as it gives him something to pay attention to in comparison to the emptyness of space. this life enventually grows to intelligence and is able to grow and claim the whole of the planet.

seeing this newfound intelligence, a couple of the lesser gods believe that giving this new race divine power could make their work more interesting and better for everything. the main god refuses this and is keen on sitting back and watching with minimal intervention. this make a couple of the gods angry as they feel they arent being heard, and decide to start their own life on the smaller planet in the binary system. there the god of land, life, and (wisdom). give the same life divine powers which allows them to grow. the main god still disporves but still is keen to watch and instead of doing anything malicious sends over another lesser god to report to him directly on the state of the planet and its life, the only problem is that he appoints the god of (destruction) and believes that he could gain favor with the main god if he could wipe out the life on the smaller planet. (go into zelda-esk story with 3 protagonists and ganon not triforce of power).

also give powers to show that gods exist and if nothing is done the beings could assume no higher being.

back on the major planet life continues to grow, since the planet are tidally locked where civilization begins the other planet is on the other side of the planet over an uninhabited continent. this means that over the development of history they never see the other planet. once the age of exploration sets in and the nations start sending exbiditions to uncover new land for their country. when one country begins to cross the large expanse of the ocean off the coast they see land after a few days, the only problem is that this land keeps rising over the horizon (maybe they spot the land the first time, mark it on the map and leave, only for the next exbidition to see it in the sky). they do find more land but this new land up in the air leaves more questions with the world around them.

back on the minor planet (i really just wanna rip off zelda) every few generations the god of destriction tries taking over the land. this is done through the corruption of a person willing to accept them. the other gods powers also rest within 3 beings, the power of the land (earth bending most likely), the courage of life, and the memories of the past with the knowledge to seal death away. time after time these 3 meet throughout time to defeat the god of destruction and bring peace, at least for a while.(wisdom vessel is an old wizzard, courage and power and 2 teenagers who have to struggle with harnessing their powers, maybe get together during the plot but i doubt i could write that)(not a full zelda ripoff :).

since the land which the main plot of the minority planet is underneath the majority planet it has become a deep part of their religion and history (they believe in the 3 gods with destruction trying to destroy them) they see the majority planet as the resting place of destruction where he stays when hes not trying to destroy the world, but not more people.

once the news got back to the old world of the land in the sky, the major emotion was shock, how could this land stay suspended, was it heaven. soon enough every major sea fairing power was trying to make discoveries about the world, so new colonies were set upon the continent below the minority planet, a majority of these colonies were smaller and more bent on figuring out what this new land in sky was rather than conquering lands for their crown.

at some point the telescope gets invented, not wanting to lose out on fame the invemtor takes to the new world as quickly as possible with full support of the crown. on the first night in the dead of night when the minority planet is its brightest the inventpr of the telescope begins his research. not much information can be figured out due to the primitivness of the telescope but the difference between the trees amd the fields are obvious, almost like an unnatural pattern is viewable, the inventor continues to work on better processes to produce clearer images, but its seen know that its a planet that has ground and surface features.

a couple years later (decade or 2 maybe) and fire burns through a good majority of the minority planet (due to the god of destruction). at this point the lens making process was refined and a lot of work was pushed into it to get a better image of the surface, turning the quest to understand this world from a race to teamwork. and with the telescope setup they can begin peering into their neighbors world to try and understand it more and more. they are able to see concentrations of where the fires are located, and less than a year after the fires it almost looks as if homes have taken their places, fields look more and more divided, and it seems more and more that this is another world. (the main church denied it being heaven when the fires broke out). Once the realization that there were the possibility of people on that planet many of the researchers wanted them to also know that they were there, the best way that they could do that would be to create a massive bonfire in the new world large enough that it could be seen from their world. preparations are made from all the trees in the new world and once lit, burns as bright as the sun for days.

the god of destruction had been defeated for nearly a year, the 3 vessels of the gods have completed their life's goal and can live the rest of their life in peace. the old wizard goes off to train an apprentice(or something), (the other 2 stick together as they have grown closer?) , sitting out overlooking the vast expanses of the kingdom the girl (not decided which power is given) is looking up at the major planet, comtemplating if destruction could really preside on such a nice looking planet. As shes thinking this a red speck appears coming from the land on the planet. shes full of fear and joy, because that planet isnt where destruction rests, and what just happened to them could happen to that planet and the people on that land, (the people on that land she thinks again).

      <h3>
          heres  my other story just so that i dont have to show it to you another time
      </h3>
      <p>
          in a world like our own everything seems to be fine. a rouge asteroid seems to have been taken into a capured orbit around the planet and ends up in a very stable pattern. this allows the scientists to get a lot of data on this tiny rock and push for a misson to explore this rock closer than any other small specimine.
The launch goes without a hitch and is able to quickly close in on the object, once within photo range different shapes begin to form, large pylons are jutting out and a majority of the light are coming from a pure white disk or a shiney yellow one. At the first hint of irregularoty the bells start going off as the people have no idea what the protocall is for anything like this.
Once close enough and images crisp enough for detail its very obvious that its a spacecraft the was built, but no one could build it in secrecy
