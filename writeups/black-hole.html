          <p style="width:37%">Real time lensing animation that was built initially in Blender. This was made as a contribution to <a href="https://icasu.illinois.edu/outreach/point-vr">POINTVR.</a> Eventually this was ported to a c# shader to be used in the Unity engine. The mathematics is simply enough that a version should be able to run in browser, Something that will be completed at a later date.</p>

      <p style="float:right;padding-top: 5%; width:40%; word-break:normal;white-space: normal">My initial workflow involed finding the impact parameter(b) to use to solve for the inflection angle(alpha). These came from some prior work I had with orbital mechanics and seemed like a good initial jumping off point.</p>
      
      <h2>Impact Parameter</h2>
      <p style="width:80%">The impact parameter is the 'distance of closest approach' if no forces acted upon the 2 objects being discussed. The key I found to being able to find the impact parameter and build a good looking model was to do the math on a larger sphere.</p>
      <p>This sphere is the maximum value that we should consider the black hole lensing to be relavant. any light that has a 'larger closest approach'(larger impact parameter) is too far away for black hjole lensing to have any meaningful impact on its direction.</p>
     

      <p>Video produced to try and explain the process.</p>
