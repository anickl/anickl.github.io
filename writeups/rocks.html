      <h1>Piles of rocks.</h1>
      <p>I found a good amount of resources to built rocks, but none of them built the rocks in mass. The few that I found built the rocks from a surface and were more for paths rather than the piles that I wanted it for.</p>

      <p>A space is defined and a vornoi diagram is used to populate it with base polygons. Due to blender these are voxelized, but that can help with random noise to some extent.</p>
      <img width="50%" src="rocks/2.jpg"/>
      <p>Because the edge of the field cuts the polygons, deleting those polygons near the top prevents these problems. Doing this shows a lot of the randomness which is wanted.</p>

      <p>Some vertex merging and offsetting is enough to get the rocks almost looking good.</p>

      <p>With some more vertex smoothing it looks good enough. There are a few missing triangles, but materials and other work does enough to mask these holes.</p>
