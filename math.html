    <p> not really sure how to bring code online, gotta learn it all ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. probably rewrite it all in javascript which wont be fun</p>
    <h3>scrabble probablility</h3>
    <p>takes any word, figures out the probablility that you would pick out the letters in that word from a scrabble bag</p>
    <form>
      <input type = 'text' name = 'inputS' placeholder = "doesn't work">
      <input type = 'submit' value = 'Submit'>
    </form>
    <h3>simple encrypter</h3>
    <p>converts base 10 to base 26 (only alphabet) and vice versa, allows for quick encryption that isnt used often, works well enough</p>
    <form>
      <input type = 'text' name = 'inputE' placeholder = "doesn't work">
      <input type = 'submit' value = 'Submit'>

    <h2>big project: baseX</h2>
    <p>takes an input, figures out the number of unique characters and considers that the base number. it then creats a number as small as it can be while making a key
    from the unique characters. when used in reverse with the number and the key you should get the input back. done correctly (which i have no idea how to do)
    it should be able to encrypt anything into a number. if used again on the number you would (maybe) get a smaller number which means you would have 2 keys and an even smaller number.</p>
    <p>this isnt completed but is close, if i do it correctly, i could take files and encrypt them while also compressing them, but i can't say it more, i have no idea what im doing</p>
