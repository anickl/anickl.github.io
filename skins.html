    <h3>M4A4 Great One</h3>
    <img src="pictures/skins/greatone/1st.png" class="half">
    <p>created the deer silhouette, put the carina nebula on it, then did a lot of background work. My firstt major drawing attempt as well.</p>
    <img src="pictures/skins/greatone/2nd.png" class="half">  
    <p>Eventually tried to remake, but it looks worse. more noise is needed throughout the pattern.</p>
    <h2>Fragment</h2>

    <p>My first go at designing skins. Utilizing structure synth and a mess of prisms.</p>
    <h3>P2000</h3>
        <img src="pictures/skins/fragment/P2k/WP.png" class="half">
    <p>the white and purple was the first skin I created. After a while I realized that I could easily switch the colors to get more designs</p>
            <img src="pictures/skins/fragment/P2k/BB.png" class="half">
    <h3>M4A4</h3>
            <img src="pictures/skins/fragment/M4/untitled2.png" class="half">
    <p>My first major skin which took much more effort. Requiring me to learn blender projections(and then relearning when blender 2.8 came out).
      I've tried remaking the skin due to some problems but I could never figure out how to get a better looking skin.</p>
    
    <h2>Neelo</h2>
    <p>name comes from the finnish word for square(neli√∂), thought it sounded not bad. Utilizes Structure Synth and a semi-reliable way to get tiling</p>
    <h3>AWP</h3>
        <img src="pictures/skins/neelo/1/thats%20a%20sexy%20pic.png" class="half">
    <p>for the AWP I had initially created the blue and green skin, but after publication I thought about using the full color spectrum which 
      I continued on for the next sets of skins</p>
    <img src="pictures/skins/neelo/2/AWPnoname.png" class="half">
    <h3>UMP</h3>
      <img src="pictures/skins/neelo/2/ump.png" class="half">
    <h3>AUG</h3>
      <img src="pictures/skins/neelo/2/aug.png" class="half">
    <p>the biggest problem for me wasnt getting the pattern set up, but the scope as the texture for it was seperate meaning I had to dig through files for it.</p>
    <h2>Lunacy Collection</h2>
    <p>With the introduction of a space themed map (lunacy) I thought about creatingspace themed skins for a collection.</p>
    <h3>M4A1-S Singularity</h3>
      <img src="pictures/skins/lunacy/m4singularity.png" class="half">
    <p>somehow I lost the source image for this skin, I couldn't get a big enough image of the black hole in order to cover the entire skin so some editing was done in GIMP.</p>
    <h3>Famas Event Horizon</h3>
      <img src="pictures/skins/lunacy/famasevent.png" class="half">
    <h3>MP7 Home</h3>
      <img src="pictures/skins/lunacy/mp7home.png" class="half">
    <p>using the earth rising over the moon image taken during Apollo 11.</p>
    <h3>P90 Moon</h3>
      <img src="pictures/skins/lunacy/p90.png" class="half">
    <p>This one was a pain due to some problems with the magazine meanings I had to do this Image a couple times in orde rfor the milky way to look good and not mess with anything.</p>
    <h3>Five-Seven Deep Field</h3>
      <img src="pictures/skins/lunacy/deepfield.png" class="half">
    <p>using the hubble deep field image</p>
    <h3>P250 Light/Dark Matter</h3>
      <div class="inline">
          <img style="display: inline" src="pictures/skins/lunacy/black%20purple.png" class="expand">
          <img style="display: inline" src="pictures/skins/lunacy/white%20blue.png" class="expand" >
      </div>
    <p>most heavily edited image I used, leaving me with a nice tileable texture.</p>
      <p>more skins were made with this pattern later, but weren't part of the original collection</p>
      <h2>Aeris</h2>
          <p>had some fun with drawn fractals for a bit and they works pretty well for a tileable design.</p>
          <h3>Galil</h3>
          <img src="pictures/skins/aeris/galil.png" class="half">
          <h3>P250</h3>
          <img src="pictures/skins/aeris/p250.png" class="half">
          <h3>UMP</h3>
          <img src="pictures/skins/aeris/ump.png" class="half">
      <h2>Bind</h2>
          <p>Quick idea I had about stripes on a skin, ended up looking pretty good</p>
          <img src="pictures/skins/bind/mp9.png" class="half">
          <img src="pictures/skins/bind/ump.png" class="half">
      <h2>Luminous</h2>
          <p>created a really nice design and went wild with the design, ended up recoloring it and repulishing it multiple times.</p>
          <h3>M4A1-S</h3>
              <img src="pictures/skins/luminous/m4a1s.png" class="half">
          <h3>Mag-7</h3>
              <img src="pictures/skins/luminous/MAG.png" class="half">
          <h3>MP-9</h3>
              <img src="pictures/skins/luminous/mp9.png" class="half">
          <h3>Nova</h3>
              <img src="pictures/skins/luminous/nova.png" class="half">
          <h3>P250</h3>
              <img src="pictures/skins/luminous/p250.png" class="half">
          <h3>P2000</h3>
              <img src="pictures/skins/luminous/p2k.png" class="half">
          <h3>USP-S</h3>
              <img src="pictures/skins/luminous/usps.png" class="half">
          <p>I would later start messing around with the hair system and blender and got something similat for the awp</p>
          <h3>AWP</h3>
            <img src="pictures/skins/luminous/finally.png" class="half">
      <h2>Hydrozoan</h2>
            <p>Named after jellyfish, I spend a long time getting this setup. The awp is my most recognized skin and the first skin I had people say I boted the response to.</p>
            <h3>Initial</h3>
            <img src="pictures/skins/hydrozoan/init.png" class="half">
            <p>created this design initially and had no idea what I wanted to do with it. Eventually I was given the idea to but and ocean below</p>
          <h3>AWP</h3>
          <img src="pictures/skins/hydrozoan/awp.png" class="half">
          <h3>AK</h3>
          <p>A skin Im almost happy with, I expanded the idea of the jelly to a space jelly</p>
          <img src="pictures/skins/hydrozoan/ak.png" class="half">
          <p>I want to flip the jelly around on the weapon, but thats a big effort that I really don't want to do</p>
      <h2>Shoreline</h2>
            <p>After creating the Hydrozoan skin, I realized I could do something with just the background of it and it could be its own design.</p>
                <img src="pictures/skins/shoreline/usp.jpg" class="half">
          <h3>USP-S</h3>
            <p>I later added a beachfront to the skin, which made it look way better</p>
                <img src="pictures/skins/shoreline/usp2.jpg" class="half">
          <h3>Sawed Off</h3>
          <img src="pictures/skins/shoreline/sawed.jpg" class="half">
      <h2>Hardwood</h2>
            <p>after these skins I took a break fron skin making and started trying to break blender mathematically (more info posted in math). When I got back I wanted to try and create a nice wood texture</p>
            <h3>AWP</h3>
            <img src="pictures/skins/hardwood/awp.png" class="half">
            <h3>Mac-10</h3>
            <img src="pictures/skins/hardwood/mac10.jpg" class="half">
      <h2>Sunset</h2>
            <p>spent a while trying to create cotton balls in blender, and even longer getting the tiling to work correctly. Only ever published one weapon for this design.</p>
            <img src="pictures/skins/other/umpsunset.png" class="half">
      <h2>Hotbox</h2>
        <p>took a good long while to get the smoke to finally work. Also my first attempt at an alpha mask to affect the wear of the skin</p>
        <img src="pictures/skins/other/test.png" class="half">
