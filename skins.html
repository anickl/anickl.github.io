    <h1>Some textures and designs made for the game Counter Strike</h1>
    <h4>Given are the renders, image I used for creation, link to the workshop where it was submitted, and any comments I have on the skin.</h4>
    <h3>M4A4 Great One</h3>
    <p>created the deer silhouette, put the carina nebula on it, then did a lot of background work. My firstt major drawing attempt as well.</p>
    <h2>Fragment</h2>
    <p>My first go at designing skins. Utilizing structure synth aand a mess of prisms.</p>
    <h3>P2000</h3>
    <p>the white and purple was the first skin I created. After a while I realized that I could easily switch the colors to get more designs</p>
    <h3>M4A4</h3>
    <p>My first major skin which took much more effort. Requiring me to learn blender projections(and then relearning when blender 2.8 came out).
      I've tried remaking the skin due to some problems but I could never figure out how to get a better looking skin.</p>
    
    <h2>Neelo</h2>
    <p>name comes from the finnish word for square(neli√∂), thought it sounded not bad. Utilizes Structure Synth and a semi-reliable way to get tiling</p>
    <h3>AWP</h3>
    <p>for the AWP I had initially created the blue and green skin, but after publication I thought about using the full color spectrum which 
      I continued on for the next sets of skins</p>
    <h3>UMP</h3>
    <h3>AUG</h3>
    <p>the biggest problem for me wasnt getting the pattern set up, but the scope as the texture for it was seperate meaning I had to dig through files for it.</p>
    <h2>Lunacy Collection</h2>
    <p>With the introduction of a space themed map (lunacy) I thought about creatingspace themed skins for a collection.</p>
    <h3>M4A1-S Singularity</h3>
    <p>somehow I lost the sourcce image for this skin, I couldn't get a big enough image of the black hole in order to cover the entire skin so somme editing was done in GIMP.
      I can't find any problemms in the end so I'm pleased with my work (except that I deleted the source image, so i instead put in the UV sheet).</p>
    <h3>Famas Event Horizon</h3>
    <h3>MP7 Home</h3>
    <p>using the earth rising over the moon image taken during Apollo 11.</p>
    <h3>P90 Moon</h3>
    <p>This one was a pain due to some problems with the magazine meanings I had to do this Image a couple times in orde rfor the milky way to look good and not mess with anything.</p>
    <h3>Five-Seven Deep Field</h3>
    <p>using the hubble deep field image</p>
    <h3>P250 Light/Dark Matter</h3>
    <p>most heavily edited image I used, leaving me with a nice tileable texture.</p>
    <h2>Other</h2>
    <p>One-off skins that I didnt like/didn't do well</p>
    <h3>Kumi</h3>
    <p>finnish for spaghetti or something. Looks like spaghetti which is why I dont like it.</p>
    <h3>Mandelbrot</h3>
    <p>2 mandelbrot sets on a skin, general problems since theres only a small amount of detail in total.</p>
